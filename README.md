# Automate_WhisperX
A wrapper for the WhisperX command line tool that can batch process multiple files in a directory. 

It requires an input directory containing the A/V files to be processed and a separate output directory to move the files + generated transcripts to after processing. 

To use automate_whisperx.py, run the script in the command line with the arguments -i [input directory] and -o [output directory].

Automate_WhisperX requires [  WhisperX ](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) and its dependencies to be downloaded to run.
